# FaceDetectionDemo

This is a basic demo of Face Detection using OpenCV's implementation of the  Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers proposed by  Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features."

I have implemented the demo in both Python and C++, both using the same OpenCV functions and overall approach.

The demos were built off of their sample code. For this implementation and adjusted it to support command line parameters for input and to produce multiple cropped images of the detected faces. Otherwise its the same as the example code seen below:
